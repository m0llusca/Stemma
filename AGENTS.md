# Memory Context

# claude-mem status

This project has no memory yet. The current session will seed it; subsequent sessions will receive auto-injected context for relevant past work.

Memory injection starts on your second session in a project.

`/learn-codebase` is available if the user wants to front-load the entire repo into memory in a single pass (~5 minutes on a typical repo, optional). Otherwise memory builds passively as work happens.

This message disappears once the first observation lands.
